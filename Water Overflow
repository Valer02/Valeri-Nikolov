//7.	Water Overflow
//You have a water tank with capacity of 255 liters.
//On the next n lines, you will receive liters of water, which you have to pour in your tank.
//If the capacity is not enough, print “Insufficient capacity!” and continue reading the next line. On the last line, print the liters in the tank.
//Input
//The input will be on two lines:
//•	On the first line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow
//•	On the next n lines – you receive quantities of water, which you have to pour in the tank
//Output
//Every time you do not have enough capacity in the tank to pour the given liters, print:
//Insufficient capacity!
//On the last line, print only the liters in the tank.
